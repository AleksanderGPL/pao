# PAO – The Game Where Your Friends Betray You (Lovingly)

![Starter Video](.assets/paointro.mp4)

## Okay so here's the deal

You and your friends are hanging out. Everything seems normal.  
But secretly… you're all *trying to eliminate each other.*  
How?  
By taking a **selfie with your target in the background.**

Yeah. That’s it. That’s the game.  
It’s called **Pao** — and it’s kind of chaotic, kind of hilarious, and surprisingly intense.

### How it works (a dramatic reenactment)
- You're chilling with your group. Everyone downloads the app (or via the website).
- You get assigned a **target** — but shhh, it’s a secret.
- Your job is to **sneak a selfie** with them *somewhere in the frame.*
- Once you snap it? BOOM. They’re out.
- Now you inherit **their** target. Repeat.  
- Last person standing = **The Pao Champion™**

It’s like Among Us… but real life. And with your actual friends.  
Good luck trusting *anyone* ever again

### Where You Can Play

- House parties
- Pizza nights
- Chill hangouts
- Class breaks
- Wandering cities
- Basically anywhere with people & vibes

Bonus points if everyone pretends it’s just a “normal night.”

### Stuff We’re Building, Soon™

- Auto target assignment
- Photo verification (AI or vote-based)
- Elimination history & stats
- In-app leaderboard
- "Gallery of Betrayal"
- Push notifications like “YOU’VE BEEN ELIMINATED 💀”

---

### Tech Stack Ideas

We're thinking:
- Expo (mobile app and web)
- Maybe even AI to verify your selfies, like face recognition so see if there are 2 ppl

### Status Report

This is a **work in progress** game project!  
We’re building it for neighberhood, The HackClub event, testing it with friends, and laughing way too hard every time someone gets Pao’d.

### License

MIT — take it, remix it, build something cool (or ridiculous) with it.

### Final Words of Wisdom

Remember:
- Trust *no one.*
- Selfies are dangerous now.
- Pao is love. Pao is war. Pao is life.
